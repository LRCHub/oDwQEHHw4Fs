[00:11.69] I'm loading up my clip, got a plan for tonight
[00:14.78] A Glock in my hand, in my pocket is a knife
[00:17.97] I'm looking for a victim pushing keys on the scheme
[00:21.31] I wanna make a stain for a million, ride clean
[00:24.52] I'm loading up my clip, got a plan for tonight
[00:27.78] A Glock in my hand, in my pocket is a knife
[00:30.81] I'm looking for a victim pushing keys on the scheme
[00:34.07] I wanna make a stain for a million, ride clean
[00:37.00] In the land of the fire
[00:49.29] Murder in the land of the fire
[01:02.02] I'm loading, loading, loading up my clip, got a plan for tonight
[01:06.06] A Glock in my hand, in my pocket is a knife
[01:09.21] I'm looking for a victim pushing keys on the scheme
[01:12.46] I wanna make a stain for a million, ride clean
[01:15.69] I'm loading up my clip, got a plan for tonight
[01:18.84] A Glock in my hand, in my pocket is a knife
[01:22.11] I'm looking for a victim pushing keys on the scheme
[01:25.30] I wanna make a stain for a million, ride clean
[01:28.44] In the land of the fire
[01:40.50] Murder in the land of the fire
[01:53.34] Murder in the land of the fire
[02:06.16] Murder in the land of the fire
[02:18.98] Murder in the land of the fire
